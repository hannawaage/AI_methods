# TDT4171 - Artificial Intelligence Methods
Repository for the assignments in the subject TDT4171 Artificial Intelligence Methods.

# Assignment 1:
In this assignment we got familiar with Bayes nets and implemented inference on a network representing the Monty Hall problem.

# Assignment 2:
In assignment two we did inference tasks on a Hidden Markov Model and a Dynamic Bayesian Network.

# Assignment 3:
In this assignment we used the maximum utility principle and decision theory to build a decision support system.

# Assignment 4:
In this assignment we built decision trees using the DTL-algorithm for classifying passengers of the TITANIC dataset.

# Assignment 5:
In assignment five we built a feed-forward neural network for classifying breast cancer patients.
